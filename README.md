#### Sam
Hey I'm Sam, I'm one of the programmers on the team, I started off this project by making the early prototype of the game from what the team had designed together. I then carried on development as the lead gameplay prpgrammer and worked on most parts of the game and iterating on all the different gameplay aspects that the designer would come up with. I have really enjoyed this project despite not being really that knowedgeable in using Unreal.
