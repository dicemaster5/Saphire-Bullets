#### Barnaby
Hay, I’m one of the artists working on this project, I helped with concepting the prop modelling. My specialism is illustration but with this project I’ve tried to get better with concepting characters and environments as well prop design. It took me some time to get the hang of what I was doing but over all I’ve enjoyed the experience and I’ve learned a lot during this project.

#### Stan
Programmer? maybe? kinda?

#### Sam
Hey I'm Sam, I'm one of the programmers on the team, I started off this project by making the early prototype of the game from what the team had designed together. I then carried on development as the lead gameplay prpgrammer and worked on most parts of the game and iterating on all the different gameplay aspects that the designer would come up with. I have really enjoyed this project despite not being really that knowedgeable in using Unreal.
